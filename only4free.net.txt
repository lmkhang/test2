MySQL 5.5 database added.  Please make note of these credentials:  
  
       Root User: adminv9ZzZjE  
   Root Password: JHr2yrNPjxFw  
   Database Name: mycloud  
  
You can manage your new MySQL database by also embedding phpmyadmin.  
The phpmyadmin username and password will be the same as the MySQL credentials above.  
  
To schedule your scripts to run on a periodic basis, add the scripts to   
your application's .openshift/cron/{minutely,hourly,daily,weekly,monthly}/  
directories (and commit and redeploy your application).  
  
Example: A script .openshift/cron/hourly/crony added to your application  
         will be executed once every hour.  
         Similarly, a script .openshift/cron/weekly/chronograph added  
         to your application will be executed once every week.
